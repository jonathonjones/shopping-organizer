== Shopping Organizer

This app is an early development. The first goal is to be able to input
multiple lists of ingredients and have them consolidated into a single list, that
can then be printed.

So, for example, if one recipe requires 1/2 cup of milk, and another requires
3/4 cups of milk, the app will create a list which says to get 1 1/4 cups of milk.

Other features I'm hoping to add include:
1) Saving recipes, and doubling/halving them, and adding to the list.
2) Organizing ingredients by category, ideally by location in a grocery store.
3) A way of keeping track, to some extent, of the food already in the house.
4) A cost estimator.
